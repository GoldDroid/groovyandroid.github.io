# [](#official-lineageos-14-1-end-of-life)Official LineageOS 14.1 end of life

As many you probably already know, [official support for LineageOS, our base ROM, has been discontinued for Z00A and Z008.](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=75362052&postcount=5446)

Fortunately, our friend [nutcasev1.5](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=7074010) will keep developing [his own ROM, NutOS.](https://forum.xda-developers.com/zenfone2/development/linos-14-1-nutos-slimified-lineage-zf2-t3654552) Basically, that will give us two important things: (high quality) unofficial slimified LineageOS builds and the chance for us to use that LineageOS base to keep Resurrection Remix alive for our devices.

Regarding to the kernel, unless moorefield gets support we will probably have to move to some fork. A proper announcement will be made if that happens.

Keep enjoying!
