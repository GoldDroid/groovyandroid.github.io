# [](#z00d-and-z00l-support-and-monthly-builds)Z00D and Z00L support and monthly builds

Since the last couple of months, support for Z00D and Z00L devices has been added. Though testing for those devices is out of reach, feedback from several users has been positive.

Due to lack of developement for the Nougat branch, the building cycle will be monthly. Once security patches are merged, a new release will come out.

Don't expect new features or big changes, Nougat future builds will be all about stability and security patches until LineageOS stops giving support for Nougat.
