# [](#nougat-builds-frequency)Nougat builds frequency

[As the RR team said in late September,](https://plus.google.com/113273376518805179283/posts/XE5CN2XjYjA) developement for Nougat started to slow down. We are mostly getting updates from LineageOS repository. We're still not sure if we will get Oreo for our devices, but in the meantime we will keep releasing new builds whenever we find commits that make us think they are worth for compiling. How often? Once a week? Twice a week? Once a year? Don't EVER ask, [because it really grinds my gears.](https://www.pelletonpellet.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/8mS65Uk.jpg)
